# J&G HEALTH TECH COMPANY

I don't want to call it a company as it is not legally registered yet. However, I want the reader to know that within the next five years, this medical entity will be a household name worldwide.

J&G Health Tech Company focuses on software development, research, and data security for the global medical and health sector.

## Founders of J&G Health Tech Company

### MUTALE GEORGE - Founder

### So, who is George Mutale?
I am a 20-year-old student from Uganda's beautiful town of Entebbe. I am currently in my first year at Deggendorf University of Applied Sciences, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Health Informatics. My potential impact has not yet been revealed in my first winter semester of 2023/2024, as I needed time to settle in as an international student who had recently moved to Germany. However, I am confident that, in the coming semester, I will collaborate with my professors and fellow students to make my vision a reality and eventually a worldwide success. Our company aims to address global health problems through the application of computing and informatics technology.

### How do I spend my leisure time?
I have some hobbies that I enjoy. Firstly, I like to read and write about God's love and how we should love others. I believe that love is the center of the universe and heals the damage in me. I'm working on a new social media platform where you can find my original love quotes and some from other great writers.

Secondly, I enjoy listening to gospel music and watching Christian movies. It helps me understand what I read in the Bible and elevates my conscience in offering praise and worship to my God.

Lastly, I like to play sports like football, cricket, and chess. I also do physical exercise because it helps me relax. I would love to learn how to play the acoustic guitar, so if anyone is willing to teach me, I'm open to it.

What is George’s language set and skill set?
I am proficient in English, Luganda, and Lusoga. I can also speak and write basic German. Furthermore, I have professional experience in photography and graphic design and possess basic skills in Python, HTML, and CSS.

### ARYAMPA JOSHUA - Co-founder 

A little about Joshua

He is a 21-year-old Ugandan, born in Mbarara - one of the towns in East Africa known for cattle keeping. Currently, he is pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering at Makerere University, one of the top universities in Africa.

Joshua is a God-fearing, visionary altruist who is determined to have a positive impact on people by empowering them to develop holistically. He believes this is the key to a better world. Joshua loves learning and researching, especially through edutainment.

### How J&G Health Tech Company was conceived
Initially, we had to identify a significant problem in the world, brainstorm solutions, devise strategies to implement them, define our mission and vision, and ultimately transform everything into a success. As a budding company, we are still in the process of accomplishing some of these tasks. I understand that this may require further clarification, so let me elaborate on it here.

### What was the world’s problem?
Joshua and I discovered that Ugandans have access to various technological gadgets such as laptops, phones, watches, televisions, and others but they are not adequately educated on how to use them effectively. This means they miss out on vital medical and health information and applications that could possibly save their lives and improve their daily existence and well-being. Further research revealed that there are medical applications that need improvement to make them more user-friendly, especially for junior medical workers. Unfortunately, some Ugandans have a phobia of acquiring these gadgets, thinking they are unnecessarily expensive and only useful for making calls, sending text messages, or checking the time. However, these gadgets have untapped potential to improve their health. Our attention was drawn to how most Ugandans underestimate technology and indirectly undermine their health, which could be a global problem, particularly in second and third-world countries. As a company, we intend to explore ways to mitigate this problem.

### Solutions to the problem
During our high school years, we studied Chemistry, Mathematics, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) together. However, Joshua was additionally taking Physics, while I focused on Biology. Currently, Joshua is pursuing software engineering, and I am studying Health Informatics. Our company therefore has a team of future experts in both medical and computing fields, and our goal is to use our combined knowledge and skills to educate Ugandans on how to use their gadgets for paramedical support beyond entertainment.

We plan to eventually expand this initiative to other countries. In addition, we have also equipped ourselves with graphic design skills to create excellent branding for our services, making more people aware of our company. By the end of our bachelor's degree, we hope to master web development and make more connections who can support our cause.

### How shall we implement this solution?
Firstly, we need to establish a network of medical professionals and computing specialists to conduct thorough research in the field of health and technology. We should then create reliable software systems that can efficiently collect and store data. It is crucial to build a secure system that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the collected data. My commitment to data security has motivated me to pursue a master's degree in cybersecurity and establish connections with like-minded individuals in my class, as they are the ones who most likely will support this noble cause. Finally, we should continuously monitor the progress and impact of our efforts on society and identify areas of improvement where inefficiencies exist.

## MISSION
To promote the well-being of all by spearheading the application of computing and technology in healthcare, recognizing that HEALTH IS TRUE WEALTH.

## VISION
To establish telemedicine as a widely adopted practice across the globe.
