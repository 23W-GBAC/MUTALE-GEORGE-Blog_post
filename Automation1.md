# WELCOME TO MY AUTOMATION JOURNEY
---
Guten Tag,
Welcome to my digital abode, where in this week on 26/12/2023 I have embarked on an exciting journey of automation and creativity. In this blog series, I will guide you through the realm of building a Dynamic Portfolio Generator.The mission? To transform the repeatitive process of maintaining a portfolio into a seamless experience.

## THE PROBLEM OF THIS WEEK
---
I spent several hours updating project details, adding new achievements and wrestling with design. The more time I invested in perfecting my digital showcase, the less time I had to actually focus on creating new projects and honing my skills. This begged for skills

## SOLUTION
I thought  of designing a portfolio generator.  I opted for a combination of python as the scripting language and Jinja2 as the templating engine

### WHY PYTHON?

- Versatility: Offers rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries
- Readability: Scripts are easy to understand
- Community support: Easy to seek help from fellow developers

### WHY JINJA2 AS THE TEMPLATING ENGINE?

- Flexiblity: Allows to separate HTML from dynamic content
- Widely used: commonly used in python community which ensures a wealth of resources

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
```
portfolio-generator/
|-- data/
|   |-- portfolio_data.json
|-- templates/
|   |-- index_template.html
|    
|-- output/
|-- generator.py
```
#### Explanation
 - Data: This directory contains information about projects, skills, education and contact details.
 - Templates: Contains HTML templates where each correponds to a section on the automation website
 - Output: Contains the generated HTML files
 - Generator.py: Reads data, populates templates and generates html files 

### RECEIVE MY CALL
 As I set the stage for the automation project, I'm eager to hear your thoughts! Specifically:

Tech Stack Feedback: What are your thoughts on the Python and Jinja2 stack? Any alternative suggestions?
Initial Project Setup: If you explore the repository, does the initial structure make sense? Any improvements or suggestions?
Feel free to fork the repository, experiment with the project, and let's embark on this automation journey together. Your feedback is invaluable!
